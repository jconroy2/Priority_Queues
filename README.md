# Priority_Queues
This program creates an interactive priority queue where lower values have higher priority. Users can choose one of three implementations—an unsorted linked list, a sorted dynamic array, or a min heap—to manage the priority queue. The program provides a hands-on demonstration of different data structures for priority queue operations.
